# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 21, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Completely changed CSS on existing To Do App

**Thoughts:** I decided that a good start to my first #100DaysOfCode challenge would be to restyle a to-do app I built for a boot camp project, updating the CSS and fixing some bugs with button submission.

**Today's Progress**: Corrected positioning for top and bottom captions in Meme Generator

**Thoughts:** I came back to this project after about 3 months and messed around with the CSS positioning of the top and bottom caption divs and I finally got the positioning sorted out to where the captions are showing up where they should be when the "Generate Meme" button is clicked.
