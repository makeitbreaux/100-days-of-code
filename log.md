# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 21, 2021 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Completely changed CSS on existing To Do App

**Thoughts:** I decided that a good start to my first #100DaysOfCode challenge would be to restyle a to-do app I built for a boot camp project, updating the CSS and fixing some bugs with button submission.
